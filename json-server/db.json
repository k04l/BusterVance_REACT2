The B300S modular battery weighs 84 lbs is equivalent to a 12v, 250 amp-hour, LiFePO4 battery bank. If I need more power down the road I can simply get another B300S, all the way up to an 18 kWh system which is way more than Buster will ever need. The AC500 has 5 x 120V outlets from 20A up to 50A, 6 x USB Ports, 1 x 12V/30A and 1 x 24V/10A. I can via an AC charging cable (essentially shore power), or via up to 3,000W of Solar Panels."
